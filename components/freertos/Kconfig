        This version of FreeRTOS normally takes control of all cores of 
        the CPU. Select this if you only want to start it on the first core.
        This is needed when e.g. another process needs complete control
        over the second core.

        FreeRTOS needs a timer with an associated interrupt to use as
        the main tick source to increase counters, run timers and do
        pre-emptive multitasking with. There are multiple timers available
        to do this, with different interrupt priorities. Check

        FreeRTOS has the ability to store per-thread pointers in the task
        control block. This controls the amount of pointers available;
        0 turns off this functionality.
